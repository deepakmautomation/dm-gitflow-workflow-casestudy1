**Git-Flow workflow**

An XYZ software company was using Centralized Version control system in which they used to push all the code in a central repository at the end of day.
-If there are any network issues they won't be able to access the repository and cannot commit the changes.
-If there is server downtime, then Developers need to wait until the server is up. 
-In terms of Scalability, as the team grows the codebase will also expand and that will cause the performance issues.

So to Solve the problems like I mentioned above, the Solution is **Git-Flow WorkFlow**.
-With this approach developers can have the full copy of repositoy.
-Below is flow chart diagram for Git-flow Workflow
